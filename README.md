# KerasCodeGenerator

***

> This project aims to bring a more streamlined way to create machine learning models using the Keras functional API.
> This project does not run your model in the editor, but instead generates python code that can be copy-pasted into a python interpreter.
> This is a passion project that was created in a relatively short amount of time. Please don't expect much for now.

To get started, download the install wizard from any released version of this project and run the installer. Open the application and create your first graph!

Instructions on making a model:
- Click the '+' button on the GUI to add a new node to your graph
- Drag out connections to and from graph nodes to create a model
- Edit model parameters using the "options" button on each node
- Once your satisfied with your model, click "compile" to generate the code for your model
- The generated code will automatically be copied to your clipboard
